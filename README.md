A Weather Bot
=============

Brief Description
-----------------

Why do I need a bot?

I travel frequently to various places and would like to know the current temperature and alerts if any for the city I am in. My bot should send me a SMS every day informing me this. I don’t have a smartphone but a plain old and reliable mobile which can accept SMS.

To get the weather information, I am going to make use of the Forecast API.

CONFIGURATION
=============

There is a config.rb.example file in the project root. You will want to copy this to config.rb and then add your your API key.  It gets loaded in extract.rb so that it never gets commited to the repository.
